Team of Teams Daily Progress Report Functionality:

Example Implementation: http://www.teamreporterapp.com/

Our Implementation:
Every time a team member checks-out from the web app he/she will be asked to submit a daily progress report which will contain the following three fields/questions on this url 
http://www.teamofteams.io/user/zia/panacloud/team2/submit-progress-report/auto-generated-id-for-date :

What did you accomplish today?

What will you do tomorrow?

What obstacles are impeding your progress?



When a team member does automatic check-out from a mobile a notification will be placed placed on his mobile stating that a report is due. An email will also be sent to him/her:

//***********

Hi Zia Khan!

Please file your report for team Panacloud Team2. Filing the report usually takes less than 2 minutes.

Thank you.

//*************


If a team member does not check-in for a particular data no report will be due that day. 


These reports will be able to be viewed by all the team members, this will tell the team members what everyone is doing thus avoiding unnecessary meetings and better coordination. 

The reports will be organised by date and by team member. It will also contain the checked-in hrs for the day.

We will finalise the UI for this feature report and forms after discussing with each other and Asif Bhai.

	create() = isCurrentUserTeamMemberAndSame(tot-id, team-id, auth.uid, user-id);
}

type ProgressReport {
