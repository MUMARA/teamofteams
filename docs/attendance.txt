Have started thinking about attendance system:
First read this:
http://www.ijcte.org/papers/832-S2004.pdf
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence
http://www.quora.com/Geo-fencing

An app similar to ours (on Web, Mobile, Tablet):
https://www.simpleinout.com/

Lets first figure out what will be the functionality for marking it manually. Later we will do it with geo fencing and iBeacon or may be other technologies.

First we will see what type of event is it?
Is it a recurring event or one time only?

One Time Event e.g. office meeting
If it is a one time event what is the title and description of the event.
What is the event date? What event time?

If the type is daily attendance e.g. office attendence, the images are as follows:

It can also be not daily but may be once, twice, or thrice a wk e.g class attendance
